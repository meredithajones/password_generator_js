Project Title: Meredith Jones' Javascript Password Generator
=======================================================================
I embarked on the project of building a Javascript program to generate secure and varied passwords in order to enhance my understanding of some of the things that Javascript is able to do as I begin learning about the language. 
The password generator needs to have the functionality of allowing the user to decide between upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters, if they would like to use some or all to make up the password. I also needed to dictate that the password needs to be between 8 and 128 characters when it is generated. 

I was given all of the starting html and css code to create structure for the javascript to create the password. 

Initially, I found this project to be extremely challenging. I began by writing pseudocode to map out all of the steps that I knew would need to take place in the javascript. Through all of the mapping, I began to feel more confident about doing the research to find code that would work to generate passwords. I received help from numerous online sources including W3schools, Stackoverflow, geeksforgeeks.com, as well as the Travery Media Youtube channel tutorial on building a Javascript Password generator.

As has been my experience, many of my mistakes were more simple that I was expecting. Online tutors through the ASKBCS Learning Assistant ended up helping me catch typos and unclosed brackets which at times threw off my code. I was also assisted in the homework by my tutor Joey Rodriguez, who helped me to understand the key step of placing the options password characters into an object as seen in the screenshot below:

In the end, I put well over 24 hours of work into creating the generator, but it was a very satisfying project to complete once it worked. As you will see in the screenshot below, it produces a very complex password:
